# microfinance project

Microfinance institutions are very important in our daily lives. Many have benefitted from the 
serverces of microfinance institutions by doing daily savings of little amount which has
enables them to solve thier live problems.

In fact many banks operate today base on some of the money microfinance institutions link up with them.

Most microfinance institutions operate by having daily collectors who go around the town/city colleting daily savings from thier customers.

Most at times, this customer are located in different geographical areas in the town or city, so the customers are usually divided into geographical zones.

The daily collectors moves around with a book where he/she records the savings of each customer and the customers also keep a booklet for thier daily savings.

This procedure is usually manual, that is the record are filled with pen and the calculation done manually. Even at the end of the month when the customer wants to collect his/her money. The interest, charges etc are usually calculated manually by summing the customers savings and then performing the deductions.

With the advent of the internet and given the fact that atleast everyone can support data daily, this whole process can be digitalized as follows:

### 1. Provides a web application for the microfinance institution to hos their information online which can be access from everywhere

### 2. Provided collectors with a mobile app which enables them to easily fill in customer savings.
